# Hand-Gesture-Controller

This project implements a hand gesture controller using OpenCV for image processing, Mediapipe for hand tracking, and Arduino for hardware interfacing. The system captures real-time video input, tracks hand landmarks, and utilizes Pyfirmata to control LEDs on an Arduino board. The number of glowing LEDs corresponds to the number of fingers detected in the hand gesture, creating an interactive and intuitive interface for computer interaction. The code and setup instructions are provided in this repository, allowing you to easily replicate and experiment with this hand gesture control system.

Features:
1.Real-time hand tracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV.
2.Arduino integration for controlling LEDs based on detected hand gestures.
3.Pyfirmata for seamless communication between Python and Arduino.
4. An intuitive and hands-free interface for interacting with electronic systems.

Requirements:
* Python 
* OpenCV
* Mediapipe
* Arduino board
* Pyfirmata
